### Purpose

    The purpose of this web app is to aide developers in their process to quickly and efficiently add JSDocs and PropTypes to their own code.

### Benefits

    As a developer, documenting one's own code is integral to the process. While in-depth Wiki and other structures are the preferred methods of documentation, JSDocs and PropTypes are the first line of defense. These tools help the developer and the developer's team to understand in real time the purpose of the each individual Functions or Components.

### Getting Started

    In order to get started - a simple frontend is all one needs. Simply run `npm i && npm run start` in the root directory, and the project should be made available on localhost:3000.

### Contributing

    To those who are feeling generous enough to contribute, thank you. The standards are as follows:
    - Please label all branches as 'feature/<feature name>' or 'bug/<bug name>'
    - Please document any new functions or components with proper JSDoc and PropTypes (base level).
    - Please use Functional declarations, they are easier to debug.
    - Proper spelling and capitalization is required within documentations.
    - Please allow 1-2 weeks for review.
